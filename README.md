Pixel Engine is an open-source 2D game engine library for C++ and the Windows platform. Pixel Engine also comes with a level editor to create 2D levels that can be loaded by the engine's API. This is one of my first attempts at creating a game engine and this is mostly just a learning experience for me.

## Libraries
Pixel Engine utilizes the following third-party libraries:
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) (Open Graphics Library)
- [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
- [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) (wxWidgets GUI Library)
- [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/) (FMOD Sound System)
- [gainput](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/gainput) (gainput Input Library)
- [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) (The Curl Library)
- [RakNet](http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/) (RakNet Networking Middleware)
- [GLUT](https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/) (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) (OpenGL Extension Wrangler)
- [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html) (OpenGL Mathematics)
- [SOIL](http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html) (Simple OpenGL Image Library)
- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) (Boost C++ Libraries)

## Usage
The engine is currently still under development and the SDK is not available yet. The first stable release of the engine (alpha 1.00) will be released once I am able to create the game "pong" with the engine. Ignoring that, the most recent build from the sources on this repo can be found in the "Build_Release" folder so you can check what everything is about.
