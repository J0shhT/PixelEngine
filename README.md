Pixel Engine is an open-source 2D game engine library for C++ and the Windows platform. Pixel Engine also comes with a level editor to create 2D levels that can be loaded by the engine's API. This is one of my first attempts at creating a game engine and this is mostly just a learning experience for me.

## Libraries
Pixel Engine utilizes the following third-party libraries:
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) (Open Graphics Library)
- [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
- [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/) (FMOD Sound System)
- [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) (The Curl Library)
- [RakNet](http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/) (RakNet Networking Middleware)
- [GLUT](https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/) (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) (OpenGL Extension Wrangler)
- [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html) (OpenGL Mathematics)
- [SOIL](http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html) (Simple OpenGL Image Library)
- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) (Boost C++ Libraries)

Pixel Editor utilizes these additional third-party libraries:
- [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) (wxWidgets GUI Library)

## Usage
The engine is currently still under development and the SDK is not available yet. Ignoring that, the most recent build from the sources on this repo can be found in the "Build_Release" folder so you can check what everything is about.

## Open Source
You are free to copy and use parts of my source code. The solution files for the engine are not included in this repository **yet** so if you want to compile it yourself, you are going to have to figure it out on your own.
